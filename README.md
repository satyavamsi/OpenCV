small side projects using opencv

1.Manual Portrait Mode
 I want to write a python code in which you specify your objects rough coordinates and the code will convert your image into a portrait image.
 1. I will first extract the foreground of the image
 2. Plot a contour of the result image and smooth the edges 
 3. After getting the counter inverse the region and apply blur effect to the original image
 I dont know if its the right method but I started it anyway. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated
